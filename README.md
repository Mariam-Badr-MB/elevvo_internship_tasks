# elevvo_internship_tasks 🚀

This repository contains the machine learning tasks completed during my **Elevvo Internship**.  
The projects cover a range of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **german-traffic-sign-classification.ipynb** → Deep learning project for classifying traffic signs.  
- **mall-customer-segmentation.ipynb** → Unsupervised learning project using clustering to segment mall customers.  
- **student-score-prediction.ipynb** → Regression model to predict student performance based on study hours and other factors.  

## 🔑 Key Highlights  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Applying ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering)  
- Model training, evaluation, and visualization  
- Hands-on experience with Jupyter Notebooks  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning)  
- Jupyter Notebook
